    "# Task2 Question: How to define and customize priority queue and implement an example?\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of two ways to implement a customized priority queue in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using the queue module:\n",
    "        Import the queue module: import queue.\n",
    "        Create a PriorityQueue object: priority_queue = queue.PriorityQueue().\n",
    "        Add elements to the priority queue with a custom priority using the put method: priority_queue.put((priority, element)).\n",
    "        Remove elements from the priority queue using the get method: priority, element = priority_queue.get().\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using the heapq module:\n",
    "        Import the heapq module: import heapq.\n",
    "        Initialize an empty list to serve as the heap: heap = [].\n",
    "        Add elements to the priority queue using heapq.heappush: heapq.heappush(heap, (priority, element)).\n",
    "        Remove elements with the highest priority using heapq.heappop: priority, element = heapq.heappop(heap).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other possible ways to implement a customized priority queue in Python include using a dictionary and maintaining the elements in sorted order based on their priorities. This approach allows for direct access to elements using their priorities as keys, making it efficient for certain use cases. However, it may require additional logic to maintain the order of elements when adding or removing elements from the queue.\n",
